# cuppaeverythingProfile

Remember to change the package name to yours
And change the log out destination in Profile.java

Another thing is that I did not build database for this section, so the "Edit Profile", "Change Password", and "Linked Accounts" will not be functioning.
I've only put some validation methods (to check whether each input field is empty, and will output toast message if fill in successful).
So if you want to implement the "update profile information", you might need to add some more sql queries onto the database that you've build and add the respective java code onto my java file by yourself.
